# A 3D ex vivo biological lung motion simulation device(3D-BioLungEx) was designed to replicate human lung respiration. Radiotherapy plan of the patient was transferred to biological ex vivo lung, where 3D-BioLungEx simulated treatments under various respiratory patterns. An Iterative Optimization and Scatter Inversion-based Dose Distribution Retro-Analysis Algorithm (IOSI-BLDose) was developed to calculate the dose distribution during treatment.
